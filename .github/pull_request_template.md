## What changes

<!-- One or two sentences. -->

## Checks

- [ ] `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run check` and `npm run example` pass, and the files under `examples/output` are the ones `npm run example` wrote
- [ ] A change to a rule, to how a field of a runbook is read or to a phase or strategy name is described in docs/method.md, says what it can and cannot see, and has a test with the runbook written inline and a near miss on each side
- [ ] A change to what the tool cannot see is in docs/limits.md
- [ ] A change to a key of the configuration, to a field or column read, to an alias of src/phases.js or to a default is in docs/inputs.md and in the README
- [ ] A change to a point of a public page is in src/data.js, research/sources.md and docs/rules-and-sources.md, in this project's own words, with no long quotation
- [ ] Nothing in the change, the README or the output reads as a go/no-go decision or a certification; the tool reads what the runbook says and runs none of it
- [ ] The CSV reader still refuses a quote out of place, and the JSON reader still refuses a repeated name; a name that is none of the phases, strategies or columns is reported, never matched to a near one
- [ ] No pattern is built from the runbook, the application file or the configuration
- [ ] Every walk of the dependency graph stays iterative, with no recursion, and reads each step and dependency a fixed number of times
- [ ] Text from the input goes through `safeText` before it reaches the output or an error message, the GitHub format escapes what a workflow command gives a meaning to, and the CSV format neutralizes a leading formula character
- [ ] The tool still reads no clock and no locale, opens no network connection, runs no program, evaluates nothing it reads, follows no symbolic link and writes nothing to disk
- [ ] Work stays bounded: the limits of docs/limits.md hold, and a hostile test has a time check that widens under coverage through `NODE_V8_COVERAGE`
- [ ] A test that depends on the operating system (a link, a device, file permissions, a character a file name cannot hold) is guarded with `process.platform`, asserts no line of its own, and builds its paths with `resolve()` from forward-slash names
- [ ] No real company, application, person or email address in fixtures or examples, and no number that reads like a year anywhere
